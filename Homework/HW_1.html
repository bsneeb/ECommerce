        <h1> My Opinion on Reclaiming Conversation </h1>

        <p> 
            The opening few pages discuss the constant need for communication between students on 
            their phones. Although some students may be discussing a serious matter, the constant 
            need to check social media may be damaging the minds of some students. For example, 
            the "two minute" rule one student noted is far too obsessive to check social media.
            I believe the device-free method with a short break is beneficial, because it totally
            removed the urdge to check your phone. The idea of multitasking in this reading is 
            interesting to me, because I totally agree with Turkle. In my opinion and experience,
            it is totally impossible to text or use social media and absorb all the necessary information
            from the class. When Turkle touches on her point of knowing when you can multitask is a valid
            statement to me. In class, it is not time to multitask. But, if I am doing a casual homework 
            assignment, I feel as though I can choose to multi task, by checking my phone or texting,
            while I still get my work done.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another interesting point Turkle mentions is the fact that the answers to our questions are
            right at our fingertips. The ability to search and find answers to our questions and find 
            a the correct information is an important one to work on as a student, but once it becomes 
            a crutch or distraction is where I believe the issue resides. There are many things students
            should know by memory, but I believe the ability to Google and find the correct answer that way
            is an important skill in itself. I agree with Turkle when she states "You need to have a strong
            background of facts and concepts on board before you need to know them". That statement applies to
            us computer science majors, because lots of code and concepts are out there on Google, but when it
            is time to do a project, it is crucial to understand the fundamentals.

            My experiences since COVID has changed the way I look at learning with technology on hand. I have found it 
            to be rather distracting to have my laptop and phone nearby while learning through Zoom, but it opened my 
            eyes to a different way of learning. First, it enhanced my ability to control my distractions, since they
            were nearby all class. It transitioned nicely to my remote internship last summer, because I knew how to
            work remotely with distractions nearby. It was still difficult at times, but since last year was mostly 
            remote, I felt prepared to take on my internship. Throughout highschool I felt distracted by technology since
            we also used laptops and iPads. It was difficult at times since games and social media were so accessible. But,
            since going through difficult classes last year during COVID, it forced me to manage my time and distractions 
            better. Secondly, I learned how to find resources on Google during last year and my internship. I enhanced my
            ability to gather data and apply it to my work while still learning key concepts for my school and work. Overall,
            COVID was a pain to deal with, but I think it made me a better student overall.
