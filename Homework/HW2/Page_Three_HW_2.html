        <h3> Some of my favorite things to do in Vermont: </h3>
        <ul>

                One of my favorite things to do in Vermont is explore and fly fish rivers for trout.
                Trout are my favorite fish to target, because of their elisiveness and their beauty.
                The different trout in Vermont that I target include:
                <ul>
                    <li> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brook_trout> Brook Trout </a> </li>
                    <li> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_trout> Rainbow Trout </a> </li>
                    <li> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_trout> Brown Trout </a> </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Another favorite thing of mine here in Vermont is skiing. Since we get the student pass
                at Sugarbush, that has been my favorite Vermont ski mountain.

                A new activity I have been getting in to is hunting. My friends and I have been exploring various 
                new lands to do some hunting on. I hope to have a fair-chase hunt this fall, and hopefully
                put some meat in the freezer.

                One of my all time favorite activities is golfing. Up here in Vermont, there are plenty of great courses
                to play at. These include:
                <ul>
                    <li> <a href=https://www.essexccvt.com/> Essex CC </a> </li>
                    <li> <a href=https://www.linksatlangfarm.com/> Links at Lang Farm </a> </li>
                    <li> <a href=https://www.kwiniaska.com/> Kwinisaka </a>  </li>
                    <li> <a href=https://catamountcountryclub.com/> Catamount CC </a> </li>
                </ul>
                My favorite of these courses is Kwinisaka. They have a great practice facility and course.
