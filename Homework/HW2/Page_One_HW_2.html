                Hello! My name is Brady Neeb. I am a student at St. Mikes studying Computer Science and 
                Math. I am the President of the Backcountry Hunter's and Angler's club here on campus.
                I enjoy fishing, skiing, hunting, and all other outdoor activities. I have two sisters,
                McKenna and Riley, and a dog named Harley. Harley loves to chase tennis balls around and
                swim. She is the fastest dog I have ever seen. I graduate this Spring, and I hope to get a 
                job that involves computer science and math. Over the summer, I worked as a SEO Analyst,
                working with a team to get our website rankings higher, increasing site traffic and 
                business conversions. It was a interesting blend of business, data science, and computer
                science.
