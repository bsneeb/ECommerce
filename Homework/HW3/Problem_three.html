        <h1> Chapter 7 - "The Code" </h1>
        <p>
            Lessig explains various problems associated with the regulation of frameworks in computers can pose a 
            threat to a society. He draws a comparison on regulation with smoking, and how there are some constraints
            that are associated with smoking. Simple regulations, such as the age to buy tobacco or certain places 
            that don't allow smoking, are simple rules that is generally accepted by the public. These are not the 
            only factors that go into the choice of smoking though, as there are "Norms", which are social constructs
            that may stray a smoker from smoking in different situations. There is also the factor of cigarette price,
            since some smokers don't want to spend lots of money on expensive cigarettes, or it may stray the new smoker
            away from smoking because they do not want to waste all of their money on a new, expensive habit. The final 
            constraint of this situation is the technonogy. Some cigarettes may appeal to certain people due to the amount
            of tobacco, flavor of the cigarette, or nowadays, a vape is a new type of technology. These four constraints,
            law, market, norms and architecture, relate to computer regulations as well. 
            <br><br>
            One regulation that comes to mind that relates to this comparison is hacking email passords. When it comes to 
            social norms, most people would not ethically do such a thing, since it is an invasion of privacy. Many would
            not do such a thing, since they would not want it done to them. Similar to Lessig's example of smoking in a
            elevator, it is not courteous to do that to another person. In regards to law, it is not legal to breach 
            someones personal email through hacking passwords. According to criminaldefenselawyer.com, convictions for 
            computer hacking results in fines, or even 5-10 years in jail. This surley helps steer people away from 
            commiting this act of crime. Next, the architecture or technology is plentiful for hacking someones email
            account. It takes a determined person, but with a computer and a bit of research, it can easily be done
            with little resources. This may encourage the hacker to hack, but the risk of being tracked or caught is 
            very great. Lessig's last constraint ties into the technology aspect of hacking. The market to hack someones
            computer is not a complicated one. It takes a determined person with a everyday computer, and a bit of knowledge
            and time to execute a successful hack. The sum of these elements create the "regulation" according to Lessig. 
            Although there are many aspects that go in to a computer hack, I think it comes down to a ethical delemia. 
            Getting your information stolen online is a very scary thing, since it the victim is never sure whether it
            could be someone practicing their advanced computer skills, or even worse, it could be someone who steals 
            all of your information online. Lessig makes good points about the notion of "regulations", and it is evident 
            that his model applies to technological problems as well.
