            <strong> Chapter I. </strong>
        </h2>
        <h4> 
            <i> Down the Rabbit-Hole </i>
        </h4>

        <p>
            Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the
            bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into
            the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or
            conversations in it, <q>and what is the use of a book,</q> thought Alice
            <q>without pictures or conversations?</q>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the
            hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of
            making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and
            picking the daisies, when suddenly a <a href=https://rabbitbreeders.us/florida-white-rabbits-for-sale/> White Rabbit </a> with pink eyes ran
            close by her.
        </p>
        <br>

        <br>
        <p>
            There was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it
            so _very_ much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, <q>Oh
            dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!</q> (when she thought it over afterwards,
            it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the
            time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a
            watch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried
            on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she
            had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a
            watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the
            field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a
            large rabbit-hole under the hedge.       
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how
            in the world she was to get out again.            
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then
            dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think
            about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very
            deep well.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had
            plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what
            was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out
            what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she
            looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with
            cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures
            hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she
            passed; it was labelled <a href=https://www.culinaryhill.com/orange-marmalade-recipe/> <q>ORANGE MARMALADE</q> </a>,  but to her great
            disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear
            of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the
            cupboards as she fell past it.            
        </p>

        <br>
        <p>
            <q>Well!</q> thought Alice to herself, <q>after such a fall as this, I shall
            think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they’ll all think me
            at home! Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the
            top of the house!</q> (Which was very likely true.)            
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Down, down, down. Would the fall _never_ come to an end? <q>I wonder how
            many miles I’ve fallen by this time?</q> she said aloud. <q>I must be
            getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would
            be four thousand miles down, I think—</q> (for, you see, Alice had learnt
            several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and
            though this was not a _very_ good opportunity for showing off her
            knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good
            practice to say it over) <q>—yes, that’s about the right distance—but
            then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?</q> (Alice had no
            idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice
            grand words to say.)
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Presently she began again. <q>I wonder if I shall fall right _through_
            the earth! How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk
            with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—</q> (she was rather
            glad there _was_ no one listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all
            the right word) <q>—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the
            country is, you know. Please, Ma’am, is this New Zealand or Australia?</q>
            (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy _curtseying_ as you’re
            falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) <q>And what
            an ignorant little girl she’ll think me for asking! No, it’ll never do
            to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.</q>          
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began
            talking again. <q>Dinah’ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!</q>
            (Dinah was the cat.) <q>I hope they’ll remember her saucer of milk at
            tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are
            no mice in the air, I’m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that’s
            very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?</q> And here
            Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a
            dreamy sort of way, <q>Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?</q> and
            sometimes, <q>Do bats eat cats?</q> for, you see, as she couldn’t answer
            either question, it didn’t much matter which way she put it. She felt
            that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was
            walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly,
            <q>Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?</q> when suddenly,
            thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and
            the fall was over.
